        <font size = "3" color = "white"> We're just a little bit closer to our early November Blockbuster web site relaunch date, and designers, writers, producers and technical people are at full out speed to relaunch on the worldwide web with the most unique entertainment web site ever. It'll be easier than ever before to purchase the latest music and videos on the street, without ever leaving the comfort of your own computer screen: buy CD's in your jammies; listen to music previews in your undies; discover new horizons of music in the Emperor's New Clothes if that's what you like, because we'll be online at full speed with a hot and happening Entertainment Central. It will let you decide -- at your leisure --- where you want to spend your time and money. We'll give backgrounds, sound bytes, photos, best sellers, previews and free stuff. There's even an all new Latin section that offers the mejor de mejor. We've got great plans for the future too, with even more opportunities to get a grip on entertainment like never before with games and books. Look for the new Blockbuster web site at: www. blockbuster.com </p>
